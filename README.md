# SDN-Plugin-Service-Store
Arbin Bhuiyan and Michael Chacko's Undergraduate Research Thesis Project
#Project Objectives
The objectives for this research project are to develop a novel implementation of a security focused “app store” and select “apps” for it, that secure IoT devices via the use of software defined networking. Software defined networking (SDN) is a nontraditional approach to networking which allows for more granular control of networks, and for the purposes of this project, an avenue to deploy security patches and enhancements for IoT devices via changes to the network. While the use of SDN as a tool to secure IoT devices is not a new idea, in this project, we build off of previous incomplete work from Yangyong Zang and Dr. Guofei Gu’s SUCCESS Lab and propose to research a new agile medium to deploy these countermeasures via standardized “plugins” available through a service store. The proposed plugins are SDN configurations for the FRESCO application framework for OpenFlow networks. As SDN becomes more popular, this service store model approach to IoT security provides a convenient alternative pathway to secure IoT devices and patch vulnerabilities versus the traditional methods of outsourcing security to the cloud in industrial and enterprise applications, and cumbersome firmware patching in consumer segments.
